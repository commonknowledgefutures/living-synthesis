- ## Description [ℹ](((bloFHUOCc)))
    - An electronics doctoral research student who used the [[[[ART]] - Questions, Options, and Criteria (QOC) scheme]] to structure three sessions of design work on a digital music composition project described how the scheme felt like a distraction or got in the way of the work being done in the 2nd and 3rd sessions, in contrast to the first session, where it was perceived as helpful. As a consequence, no explicit representations in the QOC formalism were actually produced while designing in Sessions 2 and 3.
        - > In Sessions 2 and 3, however, serious difficulties were encountered in using QOC, and no explicit DR was constructed. The designer was focused on developing two Smalltalk data structures (sketching message passing hierarchies), describing his activity essentially as "gradual refinement" of the structures. It proved difficult to articulate useful Questions, Options, and Criteria that offered any analytical leverage on the problem; Questions were either too general or specific to a particular design iteration; discrete Options were impossible to identify because the design was regarded as the gradual evolution of one Option over time; finally, Criteria remained useful only when expressed very generally at a global level of application, rather than differentiating alternatives to subproblems within the design space. (p. 282)
    - In describing the mismatch with the task, the researcher found it useful to contrast the work to be done in these sessions (for which the scheme seemed to be a hindrance) in contrast to a prior session where the scheme seemed to be a good fit and a net positive.
    - For instance, the researcher drew a contrast between "big decisions" (in Session 1) and lower-level "implementation" design work (in Sessions 2 and 3):
        - > ... the activity I was doing here was different from what I was doing yesterday __[i.e., in work prior to Session 1]__-the actual low level structures. This __[session 1]__ is more about big decisions-policies-whereas this __[refers to own notes]__ is about implementation. So this __[QOC]__ is certainly very useful for strategies. (p. 285-286)
    - And then elaborated how the scheme was "unnatural" as a way of thinking for the implementation work in Session 2 and 3:
        - > ... It was quite tricky to think in that way then __[i.e., tricky to use QOC in session 1]__ but it was useful ... but I think I'd find it almost impossible to wrench myself into thinking in that way __[for Sessions 2 and 3]__; it would be unnatural almost, 'cos it's not that kind of path that you take when you're doing this sort of thing. (p. 286)
- ## Methods Context [ℹ](((VDK_AF-BV)))
    - ### What? [ℹ](((TxRKxShXz)))
        - Video-based observational data of designers using the QOC scheme while solving design problems, complemented by debrief interviews.
            > All of the data reported in this article are drawn from video-based observational analyses of designers using QOC while solving design problems. (p. 277, __3.1. Data Collection and Analysis__)
    - ### How? [ℹ](((aPsvxGz8h)))
        The designer used QOC --- as a formalism on paper --- while doing design work on a digital music composition system, and was video-recorded over the course of three design sessions. Each session was approximately 1h and 25 mins, and the sessions were spread out over a period of 3.5 months.
            - > Study B was a longitudinal case study, tracking a Smalltalk designer's use of QOC as he developed a digital music composition system. Three sessions were recorded (each lasting for about 1 1/4 hr) over a period of 3 1/2 months. (p. 281, __3.3. Study B: Preliminary Evidence of QOC's Scope of Application__)
            - > In all of the studies, designers used pens and large sheets of paper as opposed to a software tool. Under these conditions, the authoring process could be studied with minimal interference from extraneous factors, while preserving or even enhancing properties of the representational medium such as display space, resolution, and ease of local editing. Although software tools are necessary for long term maintenance of large DRs, the core tasks of deciding how to express reasoning as structured argumentation remain essentially unchanged (p. 277, __3.1. Data Collection and Analysis__)
    - ### Who? [ℹ](((urwvcpq8p)))
        A single designer who --- based on triangulation across the other cited sources that describe the data for the same case study (such as [[@shumArgumentationbasedDesignRationale1994]]) --- was a doctoral research student in electronics.
            > Details and examples from Session 1 have been reported elsewhere (Buckingham Shum, 1996a; Buckingham Shum & Hammond, 1994). (p. 282)

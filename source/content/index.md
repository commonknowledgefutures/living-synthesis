Welcome! This website is an experimental "living synthesis" optimized for synthesis of ideas around new infrastructures for **common knowledge**, by which we mean both a) knowledge that is shared and open to all, and b) governed in a *commons* rather than a gatekept market. 

The living synthesis is structured around a "discourse graph" of claims, evidence, and arguments that can be recombined in various ways to surface new insights. The goal is to explore how we can better structure and share knowledge in a way that is open, collaborative, and dynamic.

The topical focus of this living synthesis is a bit meta: it aims to bring together theoretical, empirical, and design-oriented knowledge for how to build knowledge infrastructures that support common knowledge.

The underlying system/code for this living synthesis will experiment with things like:
- One or more "views" that aggregate around certain subsets of the discourse graph, as more digestible entry points.
    - These may later evolve into formal "arguments" or "syntheses" that more formally combine discourse nodes in structured ways that surface their evidential and argument structure.
- Spatial/interactive "views"
- More focused UIs within claims that clearly detail their underlying evidence.

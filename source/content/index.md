Welcome! This website is an experimental "living synthesis" optimized for synthesis of ideas around new infrastructures for common knowledge. 

The living synthesis is structured around a "discourse graph" of claims, evidence, and arguments that can be recombined in various ways to surface new insights. The goal is to explore how we can better structure and share knowledge in a way that is open, collaborative, and dynamic.
